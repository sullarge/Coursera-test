					<section class="sectionTitle">Crystal Habit</section>
					<p>
					The external shape of a crystal is referred to as crystal habit.Visible faces correspond to slow growing faces, fast growing faces result in corners.The crystal habit can be affected by the growth conditions (e.g. additives to the growth solution may change the habit) high energy faces will grow fastest. Crystal habit can often be correlated to crystal symmetry.

				<section class="sectionTitle">Electron Microscopy</section>
					<p>
					Electron microscopy  is a powerful tool for the visualization of particles and/or lattices (high resolution). Electrons can be focused using magnetic lenses. Gives structural information on a short length scale - Provides a 2D image - Samples are often damaged by the intense electron beams - Only very thin samples can be measured.

					<p>
					Vector It appears from the above that forces do not obey the rules of addition defined in ordinary arithmetic or algebra. For example, two forces a cting at a right angle to each other, one of 4 lb and the other of 3 lb, add up to a force of 5 lb,  not  to a force of 7 lb. Forces are not the only quantities which follow the parallelogram law of addition.
